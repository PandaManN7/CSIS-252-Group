My commenting style is normally adding single line text above an important line of code.

What I want to do: 

For header files:

I want to describe what each thing is initalizing (no long description). I think of this as the surface layer of what the code does.

For other cpp Files

I go indepth on what is happening within the function by adding almost a paragraph like description mixed with post and pre arguments descriptions.
