#----------Description---------------#

For program 4, we were assigned to use another students conversion methods and create a class associated with that unit of measurement. We then were proceeded to create methods including the following: 

1) getters and setters
2) overload relational operators
3) overload insertion and extraction operators
4) overload assignment operators
5) Copy constructor
6) Overload comparison operators
7) Instantiate default constructors


#----------How program works---------------#

Unit: Dog Years.
Unit Type: Int
Allowed unit names: {"dy", "dogyear", "dys", "dogyears"}; 
If no unit name provided it sets to "dys"


#----------How To Run---------------#


1) Enter in "make".
2) Optional: Enter in `make clean` to remove unnecessary files.
2) Enter in `prog4`.
3) Enter in unit number for the prompt.
4) Enter in unit name indicated by the prompt.

 --------------   	-----------------  ----------------------
main.cpp         	     main           Used to test all the methods in the class

dogyears.cpp 	     defines funcs		defines methods

dogyears.h     	     declarations       declares class methods



Grading Questions for myself:

Was something submitted? ---> Yes
Could it compile on smaug? ---> On local, but it should
Did the executable that was produced through compilation, execute without generating errors? ---> Yes
Did the program read from the input? ---> Yes it Did
Did the program declare a class that corresponded to a particular unit? ---> Yes, dogyears
Did the program read into an instance of the unit class? ---> Yes, unit and unitname
Did the program output an instance of the unit class? ---> Yes, getters and setters did that
Did the program test all of the methods that were declared in the class? ---> Yes
Did the class provide a default constructor that set the initial value to zero? ---> yes
Did the class provide a constructor that takes in a number and set the initial value to that? ---> yes
Did the class provide a copy constructor? ---> Yes. Did it I do it the best way..tbd
Did the class provide a overloaded assignment operator? Yes, multiple. 
Did the class provide a way to get the value? Yes, class getters
Did the class provide a way to set the value? yes, class setters
Did the class provide a full set of comparison operators? --> Yes, a lot are there
Was there a makefile? ---> Yes
Could the makefile be used to compile the executable? ---> Yes
Did "make clean" work? --> Yes
